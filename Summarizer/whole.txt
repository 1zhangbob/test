Kya banaye?
Abbe ketan ko bhi add kar
Number
Mere aur ketan ke do teen idea the
But not very great
IBM Bluemix use krna zaruri hai na
not zaruri
but you get a prize if you do and if it is good
Fir to krna padega acchr tareeke se
😜
acche*
IBM exposes a lot of good APIs, watson and all
and HP gives similar ones too
Face recognition, speech synthesis and what not.
Abbe har sponsor ke apne challenges hai.
And that challenge has to be done using tbeir API
If you make something good with their API and win, to uss sponsor ka prize milega
Abbe challenge sabka same hai. You just have to use their platform. Challenge is "Build something using our API"
Clusterpoint is an SQL DBAAS. That can be used if such is our data requirement.
But idea hona chaiye pehle
Pehle socho to kya banana hai.
NipAlert
:P
HP wali API sai lg rhi hai
and prize bhi sai hai
:P
gopro for everyone
GoPro se apne aap ko fap karte hue pic kheechega?
hahaha
bc baaki sab se to sai hai
bc credits
de rhe hain
HP api and IBM. Same same si hai
Mozilla ki phone ka app banana hai kuch?
HTML mei hi banta hai I guess. Phone mil jayega
sirf 2 phone :P
poore team k lie
Socho Socho kuch.
One guy who last time made a service that delivers food to your home

bahut logo ko potty ki problem rehti hai, time pe nahi aati
unkeliye banate hai kuch
machine learning etc lagao, when is the best time to drink water for them and go potty
or music recommender?
pain point hai bhai
music recommender to bahut hai
par ml lagane k lie potty data chaiye hoga
logo ka
bahot sara data
ye bhi ek recommender ki tarah hi hua
potty time recommender
:P
there are many difficulties hostel people face daily
uske baare mei kuch sochna hai?
data mei se hum similar user nikalenge, jo apne main user k jaise symptom show kr rhe hain and fir uss main user ko baki users ka avg potty time nikal k denge
like pranu thought about laundry
fir unki baat bhi karva sakte hai, bond over the pot
hahah
bc hagte hue koi baat kyu krna chahega
chat karenge na bhai, log game khelte hai
news padhte hai
aap chat karo, tumhe kitni aayi
bc jinhe problem hai potty ki vo to sirf dum lagaenge na
mujhe to do hi roll aaye you know
get up and close
:p
bc sabse faad idea, jo sabke kaam aega vo hai
*wait a minute bro, need to apply pressure*
weed alert
bc kisi ne nai kia hoga
:P
shayad
kia ho
par weed data
kahan se laenge
:|
saala har vo developer jo maarta ho yahi ochta hai sabse pehle
hahah
hamara bhi ek dost hai jisne esa kuch socha
social network for nashedis
sharing stories and stuff
bc sai app ban skta hai ye agar hum data laane ka soche
real time data
but good brain storming, continue rakho. koi to idea aayega
weed is illegal bro, bhaga denge hackathon se
virtually legal

founder serving two life terms
lets no go there :P
par ye app bohot logo k kaam ati

mere bhi
bitcoins mei khele thoda? new tech, not many will explore
yeah
yask ne bvpmart banaya tha for students to sell their stuff (ED wala chutyapa), books etc
waise delhi k colleges k lie
?
scale krte hain usse
bitcoins k sath
oh bc aaj hi maine padha facebook pe collegebazaar
yes, very much a good idea
hain :O
why go outside when you can get things from your college itself next time you attend lectures
mil nai rha collegebazaar
ruk
esi chudaap cheeze mere circles mei hi hoti hai
:P
fb search sucks too
i read somewhere, it is easier to improve an existing idea
https://www.facebook.com/clgbazaar
sucky UI
bitcoin ke saath ek problem jo aa sakti hai, vo ye, will people adapt to it
will people use it, and not get scared off
because idea ki practicality should be high priority?
hmm
what about
or maybe this app will additionally help people to get adapted to bitcoins
:P
an app that you and your friend join and a fixed amouint of money (bitcoin) to
and if one day one of them skips exercise, money gets transferred to the others account
some part of the money*
:D
can scale it for bets too
same caveat, bitcoins
people don't use much
in India
I guess
thulla alert app
thulla locations nearby
to avoid
thulle
:P
notif aegi, thulla nearby
:P
but thullas are getting unpredictable
they pop up anywhere anytime
and how does the app know there is a thulla
crowdsourcing maybe
yeah
and then give people incentives to mark thulla location
yeah
:D
leaderboard hoga :P
but then we are making people unsafe by telling them thulle kahan hai and not ki bhai helmet hi laga lo
:P
hahaha
lol leaderboard hahahaha
but sometimes helmet bhul jata hai banda
:p
maybe additionally we can give them low traffic routes ;)
Bc thulla nearby hona is a good thing
Positive side nahi dekh rahe ho
with the thulla nearby notif
abbe
pivot
tells you where is the nearest thulla
so you can run for help
Haan. Vahi to.
bc ye kaunsa app hai
you have a widget which you press whenb in danger
so our app would be the opposite :P
and you get thulla location (and additionally your location gets transmitted to police relatives )
or maybe
include hospitals too
and fire stations
basically google :P
and you have one complete "save me!" app
bc sab chiz hi dal de
basically bekar ui or lag vala google maps
:D
Yask. Open source me contribute karte hue sabse badi problem kaunsi aati hai tujhe?
finding the right project

yaad krta hu
bc yaad nai aa rha :
open _ .org
something
chhor ye bata
ML ka kuch soch
it gives you project and then open bugs
ML ka istemal karo kuch cool banao
ML mei pehle ye soch ki data kis chiz ka available
hai
kyuki ussi data se learn krega apna algorithm
yp
I have this million song dataset, 1.8GB ka
yo
usse kabhi try nai kia
:P
socha tha music recommender banaunga
maybe we can build something with a nice UI
par yaar bhaut ghisa idea hai

NFC BC Near field communication hai. Door kahan se aa gaya
agar cheez kuch duration k lie apni jagah se chali jati hai
to signal aega
abey wai matlb NFC jaisa sasta kuch banao
bc revolutionary hoga
mobile pe signal aa jaenge dur se :P
Par iske liye bahut saari cheeze leni padegi
Jo signal bheje.
Bande ko use karne ke liye kharidaari karni padegi kaafi.
Maybe just give a widget to tap to mark you picked up something.
Tap it once to remind you after a short duration. Tap twice for longer.
par uska faeda na
bc log krna padega bar bar
NFC se ho jaaega
Par har jagah NFC lagan padega bande ko
Vaise bhi bahut choti xheez hai. Tu to IOT ke field mei aa gaya.

Product / Solution: Is the solution solving an existing problem? How much of an impact does the solution have? How likely will this product be able to acquire users? 
Office change ho gya hai shayad knowlarity ka 😅
Ye kaha se mila?
Mail aai hai kya koi
Han
viable hona chaiy esolution
Impact, acquire users
Pranu, I think papa vala kaam
can be used, discuss karlo
we should talk to small business owners
and see if it is a problem all of them face
What problem?
Apne papa ke circe me hi pooch
Vinayak tere papa business karte hai ya job?
Business
Problem to batao bc
Bata ketan
Cybercity me hi to hai.
Knowlarity ka office.
Abbe. Ketan. We need to come up with an official sounding problem statement. Nahi to jaise harsh keh raha tha. Bahut vague lagega
Ok, so my father is running a business. He has 4-5 semi skilled workers under him for doing chores. He is the brain of the business. Takes order, makes decisions, delegates work to the employees
haan to i am saying lets discuss?
So it gets difficult for him to manage all the queries from customers, orders, quoatations
and as the work load increases, he misses a few them because he cant respond in time
and he loses track of which one of his worker is doing what.
this gets especially difficult when he is on a tour.
the work is simple, he needs to forward the query of a company to his employee, who will look for the material in the market, find competing prices
and send it to papa
papa needs to select one of them and forward to the client
then if the client accepts, an order has to be generated etc etc
we have to reduce the time he takes to write all those mails and stuff
and generate all of them automatically
and come out with ways which makes it easy for him to process orders etc
maybe pick up the material required from the mail automatically, and shoot it to the employee
so one platform where he can delegate work and keep track of things
where his effort is reduced to minimal and he can process more enquiries
and earn better profit
That is the basic idea
Profit to same hi rhega
Badhega kaise
Keeping track or orders isn't that difficult
of
profit badega because if he gets 10 orders a day, he misses 5 of them
And mail se directly core info nikalne ka soch rha hai?
Yup. But that is for later. That is making the product better.
Automate things.
Bc galti se mil gya call 😐
Basically Management system for SMEs
So, right now if he gets an order. He has to write a new mail so that clients info isn't exposed.
And send
Then when he gets the mail, hr has to again make a new mail for hiding sellers info
And then generate quotation
Order
Bla bla.
Khel sab core info ka hai. Time waste etc hota hai.
Plus no way to keep track of all the workers except call them.
Google nikalta hai jaise core info hamare mails se Now cards generate krne k lie
Maybe yes.
NLP problem hai ye
Shayad
So this is a problem he faces.
If its a problem other owners feel too
Then it should be solved.
We can discuss it, koi aur viable idea to aa nahi raha
Fsck lodu kahan mara pada hai
NLP kya hai bhai
Natural Language Processing
Okay. And oooooh
IBM bkuemix
Or HP haven on demand
API hai?
Has APIs for NLP
Iske lie?
Oh
YOOOO BITCH
Dekhta hu
Though I still can't see how anyone would miss half their business mails 😐
A man will check his mail carefully if he needs to make money
Because its not on mails all the time.
Abbe sirf mails nahi hai
Phone calls.
Its on phone too. Then sometimes on whatsapl
Texts
Plus. Its not about checking mails.
It is about *processing* them
So jab bhi call/msg ata hai he'll log that info in our app?
Every time
And we are not building a mail processor, abhi to.
Haan.
So that his employees can see it.
And he need not individually inform tham.
Everybody is on the same page at all times.
Most semi skilled workers may have not used a computer though
Thoda intuitive hona padega
UI ko
Abbe nahi. Sabke paas smartphone hai yaar.
Aisa
Bhai. UX banaega na tera bhai.
Sexy sa.
Minimal and simple.
To android mei banaenge?
That has to be decides.
Weather a web app or mobile
Mobile sounds better dedinetely
But we dont have an androud dev.
I can make android app, by generating web view but this will be the first time
Android dev meri class mei hai ek sai
Pehle pata hota
To uska bhi krwata register
Abbe aise to team me 10 log ho jaaenge
Lean rakhna hai bhai.
Everybody has multiple roles.
Abbé idea hai ye.
Web app bana denge
Mobile first.
Idea viable hona chaiye.
App to develop ho jayega baad mei when we pursue the idea.
And yes, in the beginning he logs the product once
But after that he needs no logging. Then he just needs to select the price he needs to give to the client.
Par pehle research karo, ye problem hai bhi ya nahi.

potty time recommender
current idea is management system for SMEs
😳😑
SME ?
another was tinder for music
SME ?
small and medium-sized enterprises
http://spinso.com/eqms/Screens/index.htm
i think this comes very close]
aur potty time recommender joke hai bhai
another idea was weed alert
Cms sounds boring
yeah
but useful
hai
Batato agar kissi ke paas aur kuch ho dimag mr.
vo wale idea bata yask
Ah ! Okkey ! This was a request by Akshay katyal, he wanted me to build an app that could notify the android app developers if a new comment was posted , or a new rating was given to their apps on playstore by email. Google doesn't provide is functionality as yet ! Sounds like a crucial feature to me ! We can scrape data from the website in time intervals and notify by email if any updates ?
I have written the scrapper already
But this is a very small thing
The problem solved is not very difficult to solve.
Think of something else too that this can be provided with as a feature.
our senior won at AngelHack Mumbai, he built a license license
Bahut trivial problem hai. Stand alone kaam nahi karega
any idea what that is
As a package do
Okey!
License summarization app?
License summarization.
wai
smjh nai aaya mjhe
Ispe to startup aa gaya hai
license summarization hota kya hai
Kya hota hai ye
What I am thinking is, we accept so many license agreements
"I accept"
oh
to license mei se
info extract krna?
And then maybe get fucked by the company but do nothing about it because it was in the license which we accepted.
core info
Yes. The people I know of, they were taking out the data and presenting it in readable fashion
Like benefits, dangers, areas of concern ese
mast hai ye idea to
And bhari bhari words ki replace karo by normal usage word.
Mazza aa gaya ye problem sun ke.
So now this is an idea that scales

fir bhi IPPU se acche honge xD
Poora mood off kar dia tune.
IPPU ne bana dia PAPPU
rush download ki hai
Saale yaha light hi nahi subah se.
Kaam ruka pada hai saara
:(
Soch raha hu tinder download karu
UX test karne ke liye.
:P
bc chutiya ladkia hai delhi ki :P
meaningful conversations chaiye bc ko
De denge.
:P
<Media omitted>
hahahaha
bc delhi k lie tinder jaise kuch ban skta hai? jismei kuch mile, bc tinder pe to bas photo dekh k sewa kr lo bas
koi ladki krti bhi hogi kya swipe right bc
:P
bc aisa kuch banate hain which will give 100% result
:P
Bhai tinder itna chal raha hai kyuki selection process is dead simple.
Shakal dekho, and answer in yes or no.
like facemash
Ye selection process aur kaha lag sake hai.
collegea
fests
github ke liye bana do bc
swipe left right to contribute to an issue
:D
Phone se contribute karta hu mai.
Yaar phonr pe code likhna intuitive bana dete hain.
Taaki you can code on the go.
Phone, tabs.
bc itne chhote keyboard pe
bc phone ke liye editor
Haan. To keyboard alag hoga na humara
with all the features
indentation, code highlighting
Specially keys only for writing code.
brackets and shit
Matlab { ye sab ek touch pe mil jaaye
compile krega fir banda?
but would anyone write code on phone, why would people write code on phone
git bhi dena pdega
git dedo phone ke liye
Haan bc. Android ke kernel me git integrate kar dete hain.
Maa ki choot.
kernel kyo
bina itne andar ghuse bhi ho jayega
Har android phone git ke saath aaega fir.
tujhe git implement karna hai bas, taki git pull oush kar sake
To uska shell to laana padega hi
git for windowas
is it a shell?
buttons, for pushing commiting syncing
shell stimulate kar denge, kernel nahi ghusna padega
Abbe vo chutiyaap hai. Koi bhi asli dev nahi use karega usse.
koi bhi asli dev bina compile kare code push bhi nahi karega
but we can do this thing
phone pe ye sab koi nai krega bc
people have started writing books
on github
not code, but people can continue writing their books on the phonw
Abbe html css JS ka to compile karne ki zarurat nahi.
Chrome karega vo sab.
they can benefit from git for phone
small user base
those who write books
on giuthub
for now
we can make it like
Kum se kum web ki coding to ho hi sakti hai github pe.
people can take notes on their phone
bc Google Keep hai to
we can start a new usecase for github
abbe school notes
bade notes
anything text with a history
like people use ms word
Drive?
lo ab git pe karo with full history and feel cool
yaaaaaaaaaaaaara drive ki ma ki choot
basically bas version control dikhega
phone pe
?
and yo, devs who develop for mobiles
and pull/push capabilities?
can modify code on phone and seedhe seedhe dekh bhi lenge
Haan.
an editor with git capabilities
local rep on phone BC
phone pe kyu krega koi
bc dev na krega koi bhi
phone pe
Yaar. Aise kyu soch raha.
Ye stigma hi to hume todna hai.
koi problem nai hai ye jise hum solve kr rhe hain, bas ek extra occassional option de rhe hain
phone pe karte nahi na log kyoki koi tareeka nahi
occasional
na dhanke keyboard
and na git
Aur hum hi sabse badiya UX bana sakte hai cuz we have first hand dev experience.
keyboard dena hoga with large buttons
no auto correct by default
and one touch pe brackets and stuff
Yep. With frequently used keys right on one yap
Tap*
Bhai. Ye bana sakte hain.
or maybe, witout a tap too
automatic indentation and closing brackets
fun hoga yaar
But. Ek cheez hai. How far will the hardware support us.
i searched for gitpull for mobile
Upper limit kya hai jo code compile hoke run kar sakte hain.
not a single result bro
ye cheez kisi ne explore hi nahi kari
But we need to have an app dev
see, idea hai agar achha to abhi we can just compile html css Js
Ek bhi nahi hai.
and say that this can be made to compile other codes too
but the thing is, a django dev wont have djago on his phone
same for ROR
Exactly.
there is no way to tesst
No way to test, just compiling wont solve a problem
only noobs play with vanila html css js
pros, who might need to code on the go, use frameworks
dev sirf apne repos pe hi push/pull kr skega, not on branches of forked repos, kyuki fir merge conflicts aate hain kai bar
and git push pull konsa aasaan cheez hai emulate karna
linus ne banaya tha
ham to chuitye hai
Abbe. We can make html css abhi.
Kya pata ye dekh, node alag se nikal de androud ke piye.
dude iske sath aur bhi commands chaiye hongi, sirf push/pull thodi krega :P
Liye*
abbe idea to de sakte hai, ki bc git aur phone
koi samabandh hi nahi
no connection, why?
pranu, nahi ho payega, phone pe development nahi ho sakti html css ke alawa kisi bhi cheez ki
vo bhi banda tabhi kar payega test if he is testing mobile site
All of this we are discussing cant be done in 32 hours for sure. Immense amount of research chaoe
because mobile screen pe desktop nahi la sakte
Yeah. Isko keep me store kar raha. Definitely an idea no one has though of. But not feesible right now.
Aur socho
mobile pe git
kara kyo nahi bhai
mast hai
ek choti cheez hai
my toaster is kharab, i want to buy a new toaster
i click photo of it, get prices for a new one from flipkart, amazon
image recognition API karo use
people already doing that too
okay
Ye to google goggles ke lines pe hi ho gaya
yo but ecommerce ghuseding
like soundhound
gaana karo identify and khareed lo

dbrand ko india mei mast delivery k lie $28 chaiye
ye hamare lie problem hai
isko kaise solve kr skte hain
dbrand?
a site where people meet to share shipping costs for a similar purchase
ya fir a service which provides reliable shipping
share shipping costs from the same provider
users utne nai honge shayad
60 rupay ki shipping hoti hai
bc $28 maang rhe hain
aur bhi companies mehngi shipping mangti hongi shayad
for safe delivery
Abbe nahi. Bahut bade bade log baithe hain shipping me.
import karva raha hai kya?
Plus initial investment bhi bahit zada hogi
bc dbrand indian brand thodi hai
US mei hai
mujhe kya pata tha
google kr
Ketan. Jaake dekh dbrand ki site
i thought you misspelled brand :P
tujhe kuch mangana hai to hum shipping cost share kr skte hain
:P
nope
dbrand
:P
bc mei log dhund rha hu taki shipping costs share ho ske
aisa forum bana skte hain hum
Ohh. Achaa.
par fb groups aa jate hain fir
forum banana hai koi bhi
to fb
bhater user pehle se hai
Haan. Vahi problem hai.
Pretry sure koi group hoga hi aisa.
Yaar laanat aa rahi hai apne uppar. Ek viable problem nahi sochi jaa rahi.
bc sari problem koi na koi solve kr chuka hai
:P
world hunger solve krte hain
aaja fir mujhe khana deja
an app which notifies you if there is free food nearby
Abbe ek theory hai ki koi problem humesha 100% solve nahi ho sakti.
Problem evolve ho jaati hai solution ke hissab se.
parso se yahi theory suna raha hai
An app which lets you donate extra food and clothing items to the poor.
Aap daalo ki kya kya donate karna hai.
bahut common use case hai
Ghar aake le jaaenge.
Aur donate kar dengw.
yaar ye to ngo ke liye hai
poor logo ko notify kaun krega
hum jaenge sabke ghar?
ngos hai esi
:P
middleman ki tarah
Abbe poor logo ko notify nahi karega koi.
business kahan hua
NGOs ko karenge.
poor logo ko ek ek phone de dete hai
Bhai. Hackathon me to problem solve karna hai na vus.
Vo problem hum solve kar rabe hai.
an app that finds the best schools nearby
rank them with positive and negative points
Best kis hisaab se ?
education, co-curricular etc
school ka result in board exams
Vo to google hi kar deta hai.
scrape data from the school's site, if school doesn't have a site, find an upload data
but in a presentable way
krenge
:P
comapre two schools
option
<Media omitted>
Isse zyada presentable kya lega
i crie evrytiem
but uss school k bare mei aur info? like percentages etc
logo ko site pe na jana pade individual schools ki
bc koi AI problem dekho ya kuch aisa jismei AI use kr ske :P
Haan. Millennium prize problem solve larwa dete hai usse.
Ek million chaar hisso me baant lenge
to uss hisab se mujhe kitna milega?
250,000
AI se solve karwa lenhe
$
Is P = NP? solve kr dete hain

Itna easy way hai ladkio ko objecrify karna
Do ki hai abhi.
abey kisi ladki ne tujhe kia bc?
ye puch rha hu
Abhi tak to nahi
Saale 1 ghante pehle to aaya hu

Galti se ho gaya hoga.

hat bc
Abbe teri aankhon me hawas ka nanga naach dikh jaata hoga unhe
hahaha
bc sab ladke hawas k pujari hote hain
bc sabse bada hawasi tu
aiesec mei hawas faela k aya
Yaar. Ladkio ke liye app hona chaie. Bande ko scan karo aur uska hawas percentage jaan lo
haha
Lol
I had this idea , like tinder , but it would show only Facebook friends and anonymously people would say like , and if 2 anonymous people like each other connect them . I tried to implement this but Facebook graph api doesn't give friend list Anymore 😓😓😥
There's this app, Down
Vo bhi yahi krta hai
Not anonymous though
It should be anonymous , I like cheshta , don't know if she likes me , if only we could anonymously choose our preference and find out if both of us like each other ?
Actually can be implemented by scrapping
But using graph api would have been much easier
Oye. Kuch aisa extension banate hai chrome ka which blocks all spoilers in my news feed.
By scraping the data.
Purana idea bkl
Kya bana hua hai aisa kuch
?
Yask ne hi banaya hua hai ek, removes all salman khan related things from news feed
And yo. Kam se kam 2 saal pehle padha tha, a girl, tired of getting spoilers, made one such chrome extension for twitter
And again, choti cheez.
Okaay
Ah ! Yeah.. I also made this... , it wasn't perfect but we can work on it . a chrome extension that automatically detects which song video you are watching and brings out a nice modal view with lyrics . This can also be extended for Hindi songs.
Instead of doing this what I actually ended up doing was this .. An app that fixes mp3 tags and downloads lyrics by scanning file names.
Watch "Auto MP3 Lyrics Downloader And Tagger" on YouTube - Auto MP3 Lyrics Downloader And Tagger: https://youtu.be/xlfLY868YSo
Even if file names were imperfect , it guessed the closest match
Ah ! But chrome extensions are fun to write ,lots of possibilities  .... I wrote this YouTube replay extension 😁http://iyask.me/blog/2015/01/23/youtube-autolooper-js-script-hack/
Long time ago
Bahut kaam kiye ho bhai tum
Chrome extension ideas ??
Amarok lyrics de deta hai songs ke
Unka code utha lete hain
bc lyrics to K Player bhi deta hai
Open source hai vo bhi?
lyrics na hona koi problem thodi hui
patani
pivoting from the idea of creating a code editor for phone
is there an app that lets you write books easily on phone?
what we need is a keyboard which is comfortable for typing fast
so that authors can write on the go too, jaise hi idea aaye
hai kuch esa?
Bahut keybords hai bhai.
And as far as the editor goes.
Any note making app will do.
editor nahi, bas keyboard chaiye
books ke liye
Main thing is keyboard.
Keyboards bahut hai.
but keyboards hai, to scraping it
Apne hissab se keys daal lo kissi bhi position pe.
There is this one keyboard which only takes neeche ka 10 percent
And still promises max two touch acces to all keys.
there was this idea i saw
when people want to chill
they have to ask their frends
bhai free ho
msg, call them
there was this app made in meteor
down to chill
you could mark that you are down to chill
and your friends would see
and also show events nearby to go to
sahi tha vo bhi
Hmm. Sounds intersting.
http://downtochill.com/blog/
Only difference bw this and stroll up would be down to chill functionality
and that they are not making any plans for you
just showing you events nearby
so lots of difference
anyways, that KFC mei fried chuha milne ki khabar sahi hai kya?
Nahi kar sakte. Inhone apna android aur apple app nikaal dia hai.
To pata lag jaaega ki copied hi hai.
yo, i know
Keh rahe hai ki hoax hai.
Bc kuch nai kr skte, koi idea nai hai bc 😞
coupons pade hai yaar kfc ke
koi app banana hia bc
for crowdsourcing ideas?
an app where people can enter the problems they face
so devs can solve them (and get ideas for hackathons)
Oye. Ek do coupons bhejio
Bhook lag rahi aur paise bhi hai.
bhejta hu, door pada hai phone
Zinger burger vaale bhejio
Free wale coupon hai ya fir kuch % off wale?
% vale
😞
ab saalo maine idea bataya hai
vo to sun lo
crowdsourcing f ideas
"it would have helped if i could have one place to go to find tutors"
Hasjob ki tarah ideas ko display kr denge
😜
and a dev sees and thinks its a good idea and develops
par yaaaar, again, why not a facebook group
aadhi cheeze to FB ne khatam kardi hai
Abbe forum hai ye bhi
Fuck it
Hasjob ki tarah
Kr dete hain
Ideas display
Bc aise to kuch bhi nai ban paega
yo, you can show interest or dislike
Sab kuch to fb kr deta hai
and you can see most trending idea
when you develop something, you can link back
fir to proper app discovery bhi ho jayegi
And kisi dev ne idea pe kaam khatm kr dia to uska color change krke
Link sathmwi
Sath mei
yo
App ka
Haan. Ye sunne me sahi lag raha hai.
Displaying like hasjob.
Poore idea wale post-it ko clickable kr denge
Uspe click krne se
Dev ka app
Ka link pe jaye
yo yo
Post it nahi bhai.
Cards.
Han wai bkl
ye to kar sakte hai
Material design
😎
bolo bc
Sai lg rha hai
Ye
pranu ne ek hi cheez seekhi hai bc
karte hai fir web
mushkil nahi par kaam, aasaan kaam hai
kam se kam backend pe to bahut aasaan hai
Bhai. Mai to kehta hu ionic me banate hai.
Mobile app.
Seekh bhi lunga mai 24 ghante me.
License summarization jitna impressive nai hai
ek frontend dev aur chaiye hoga
for web and if you fail
Haan bc. Aise to har ka substitue chaie hoga.
tu nayi cheez kae eaha hai na
Bhai. Nayi cheez hi use karni chaie hackathons me.
Learning.
Bc par unki api nai use krpaenge
mana thodi kiya hai bhosdi? Failure ko cover kar raha hu bas
clusterpoint ki ho jayegi
database clusterpoint ka use kar luna
GoPro HP de rha hai par
aur bc tu to pro ladka hai
😜
Data ko use kario
to show the most relevant ideas
karlio HP/IBM ki api ka istemal
Kaise extract krenge most relevant
Data nai hai pehle ka
And relevance to subjective hai, kaunsa idea kiske lie relevant ho
Kya pata
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html
NLP laga lio to tag ideas?
Yahan se kuch use kr skte hain to dekho
Kisi aur idea mei
Just in case
bahut hai ye to
lung cancer etc ki lele
aur dikha de which location is the worst for settling in
<3
Ye bhi sahi hai.
Maps api use karke dikha denge.
With color distribution and all
breast cancer, crimes, TB
ye dikhi mujhe
karlio sabka use
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
human activity recognition using smartphone, mast
Kaunsa krna hai fir idea
NLP dekhta hu mei fir
filhaal to can do hasIdea
Hmm
tu laga le NLP for tagging ideas
Han padhta hu NLP aur iska istemal 😜
and grouping similar ideas
we can also ask the viewer to select which kind of dev ishe
and why is he looking for an idea
and produce stats later
Ye to kaafi aage ki scoping hai.
no login logout in the starting at least
faltu overhead nahi le rahe
Yeah
Fsck kahan gya
Kuch bol le bc
Yask kaam karta hai bc
apni tarah nahi whatsapp pe bakchodi pelo
:P
😅
Login logout ke bina unique users hard code karoge?
Product vaali feeling nahi aati without login.
Ye mai isliye bol raha cuz mene poori tarah implement kar liya login angular me.
:P theek hai bhai
to karva dio fir loging
mai soch raha hu mai kya seekhu iss hackathon mei
Tucha sa hai backend jo already coded hai.
Satellizer vaale ne backend bhi likhe hai in node php python etc
pyara ladka hai satellizer ka
soch raha hu ROR mei banau
django <3
dekhte hai pranu ka log in ka code kaisa hai
fir pehli priority Flask ko
nahi to django
for login in todjokes i used django all auth :)
facebook se login kra lete hain
OAuth jo bhi hota hai
OAuth2
Yea!
i used django bahut pehle so not in touch with it
but okay, lets do it
django overkill na ho jaye, if flask works, we will use flask?
I am django pro :) I contributed to it :)
Haan. Fb se hi hoga login.
I made this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka6BqL8OifI
nah! django is more flexible
Flexible to falsk hai
par django is easier to do stuff
sab pehle se implemented
dekh lenge.
Front end me kya lagaya ismr?
what? flask is easier to implement :)
All auth maintains session?
or token?
Django is pre built with user model database , django all auth plugins easily integrates with it.
sessions
REST backend banana hia na
REST ke liye to tokens implement karenge
Kisliye?
REST kisliye
ya token kisliye?
REST ?
decoupled backend and frontend
use any thing on the front then, an app maybe
android ios whatever
backend doesnt need to change
Okkey! MVC models works on top of REST then ?
Okkey! I got your point
dont define V in django
justMC
:D
V hum banate hain.
so thats why i was saying, flask would work too, just a REST backend
yea :D
so Pranu runs the login logic
and hands us the token
and later we check against the token
Konsi app banani hai?
for the database, if SQL clusterpoint use kar lenge
varna Orchestrate
or IBM bluemix ka DB huhuhahaha
-_-
App konsi
?
yaar yask tu padhta hi nahi hamare gaandfaad ideas :P
batade , too many messages :/
[6/18/2015, 4:44 PM] +91 98 99 550412: koi app banana hia bc
for crowdsourcing ideas?
an app where people can enter the problems they face
so devs can solve them (and get ideas for hackathons)
okkey! thanks
Nice :)
[6/18/2015, 4:47 PM] +91 98 99 550412: and you can see most trending idea
when you develop something, you can link back
fir to proper app discovery bhi ho jayegi
kuch na hone se to better hai
but people may not like to share an idea ? they would like to work on it themselves , hire developers and build a startup themselves
haha
Abbe. Haan.
point
I wouldn't share my idea :P
those with little ambition?
bc koi idea hi na share krega :P
:X
problem not solved
users not there
:(
hamne login bhi bana liya tha batao :P
judges unhappy
:P
Shai bola. Yask.
gaand mardi idea ki
sai mei
-_-
bc image recognition mei kuch socho
:P
But this is a problem. From where to get inspiration
what say you scrape news and search for problem (NLP)
and populate in a list
research problem hai ye
kya matlab hua iska
aman madaan isi pe kaam kr rha hai
scraping the web
and finding uspe NLP
matlab maine jaane anjaane badiya idea soch liya, vaah :P
This is what I did for Routofy  , mostly scrapping , I scrapped all travel data of all buses , planes , trains , from point A to point B. Kind of like hipmunk. This startup was brought by snapdeal recently.
http://routofy.com/
scrapy use kia scrap krne k lie?
Yep!
only this
ya aur kuch bhi
Only this  , but I had to study the website in developer console , understand the complicated javascript on how they communicated with their internal APIs and then created a python script to replicate the same behavior of website and communicate with their secret API to get data :) We did this from RedBus , IRCTC , ... etc
But the idea is nice  , all travel data in one place
the same could be done for hotels
hasnt it be done pehle
?
Yes!
bookings.com
agoda
I was just writing to give inspirations
Okkey! this is what I was thinking:
but its complicated ;)
achhe idea tab aate hai jab tumhe problem khud mehsus ho and you think abbe ye ti galat hai
And I desperatly need this feature
how licence summary vala ladka must have got the idea
I want this feature : Whenever some one whatsapps me , I want that text notification in my email too. For those people who hate whatsapp (me!!! ) , but can't live without it
To saalo tumhe koi problems nahi aati kya?
I have written some automation scripts on whatsapp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRT7drIrw78
:)
Yask. Kuch to chod deta. Khud hi saari problems solve kar dega.
:P bhai
Not solved , we need to extend its functionality to send an email notification. I desperatly need this feature :)
This script can also be used to send spam whatsapp messages to lots of people
can we summarize slack messages using NLP?
Vinayak
slack has an open API and stuff
people dont want to get alienated in their teams
can we summarize the unread messages?
same for whatsapp maybe
why slack?
people can't read 300+ msgs
Slack ka open API hai na.
beacause slack lets you do it legally
and wait
https://github.com/WHAnonymous/Chat-API
isse ho skta hai kuch?
yea , but computers aren't smart enough to know whats important and whats not? How will we do this?
??
https://medium.com/@satyavh/the-real-reason-slack-became-a-billion-dollar-company-f14c22b15a29
That will be a break through :)
NLP
license summarization bhi to kia na bc
slack is addictive because people dont want to feel alientaed in their own teams
so you summarize that
hmmm...
nice article :)
padh bhi lia bc?
shuru kiya hai :P
bhai ne NLP laga ke summarize kar liya hoga
Yask video banayi iski? link do
😆
kiski :P
?
ab joke explain na karva
-_-
batao, vinayak, kar sakte hai summarize?
kr hi skte honge shayad, par messages kisi license ki tarah structured nai hote
dekhna padega
and iska scope? FOR EVERY TEAM USING SLACK
I dont think its possible , heard of trending startup News In Short? they manually shorten the news article by their team
because every team has users who are busy
yo but emotions can be gauged
maybe we can do sentiment analysis on slack messages :D
to gauge the mood
of the team
some key words can be listened for to say if someone completed a project
or somone died
okkey! but why are we focussing on slack? whats the fuss about it?
this can be done be!
we can ofc improve it later
slack because slack is one good resource for teams
and every company is migrating to it, and ditching emails
Slack has become a platofrm over which devs are making it
What really? I need to try it :) is it free?
yo free
abbe slack to 2 saal mei baap ho gaya hai
teams ke liye addictive
Again. I dont think NLP sab lagana 24 ghante me ho paaega
apna discussion ek bar slack pe krke dekhe
?
abbe to sab nahi lagayenge na
demo tayar karenge, the idea has to be good
and viable
which it is
http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7135639/slack-is-now-the-fastest-growing-workplace-software-ever
in the beginning it wont work very well, but with time it can
in our demo we can summarize chats which our algo can handle
we arent Pros, if we end up doing it for real (after the hackathon too) we will work like pros
And i checked, nobody is summarizing slack messages
here is our chance, its a good challenge
and we can do it
What do you mean when you say summarize?
that is to be decided
tell them things are important
remove all bakchodi
dates and targets to be shown
tum sab ko
email aya hoga
slack
invite
join krlo
aaja
gitter k lie bhi kr skte hain
uski API hain?
no idea
hai shayad
[ar pehle slack karlo
jayada bada user base hai
kisi aur ko karni ki zarurat hi nahi padegi ma kasam
gitter ka bhi faad userbase hai, github k zyadatr developers apne repo k bare mei baatei usi pe krte hain
aaja fir slack pe
kaam karna hai aur bhi
Yask bc slack pe aa
Aya to
Vinayak, are you trying something?
abhi tk to nai
raat mei plan hai krne ka
dekhte hain :|
Achha. Kar kuch
Tere kaabil kandho pe hi tike hai ham
bc islie keh rha hu koi aur idea bhi soch lo, ye kandhe kaabil nai hain abhi utne :P
Kuch aur hi kar rahe hai par tu research karke dekh
Shayad utna mushkil na ho
Tinder's founders were gay
Huhuhahahaha
