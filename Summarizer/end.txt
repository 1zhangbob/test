abbe slack to 2 saal mei baap ho gaya hai
teams ke liye addictive
Again. I dont think NLP sab lagana 24 ghante me ho paaega
apna discussion ek bar slack pe krke dekhe
?
abbe to sab nahi lagayenge na
demo tayar karenge, the idea has to be good
and viable
which it is
http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7135639/slack-is-now-the-fastest-growing-workplace-software-ever
in the beginning it wont work very well, but with time it can
in our demo we can summarize chats which our algo can handle
we arent Pros, if we end up doing it for real (after the hackathon too) we will work like pros
And i checked, nobody is summarizing slack messages
here is our chance, its a good challenge
and we can do it
What do you mean when you say summarize?
that is to be decided
tell them things are important
remove all bakchodi
dates and targets to be shown
tum sab ko

aaja
gitter k lie bhi kr skte hain

[ar pehle slack karlo
jayada bada user base hai
kisi aur ko karni ki zarurat hi nahi padegi ma kasam
gitter ka bhi faad userbase hai, github k zyadatr developers apne repo k bare mei baatei usi pe krte hain
aaja fir slack pe
kaam karna hai aur bhi
